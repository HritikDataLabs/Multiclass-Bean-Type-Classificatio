# Multiclass-Bean-Type-Classificatio
# Problem statement 
The goal of this project is to predict the type of bean using various features of the bean. This is a multi-class classification problem. F1-score is taken as an evaluation metric.
# Project Description
Seven different types of dry beans were used in the research, taking into account the features such as form, shape, type, and structure by the market situation. A computer vision system was developed to distinguish seven different registered varieties of dry beans with similar features in order to obtain uniform seed classification. For the classification model, images of 13,611 grains of 7 different registered dry beans were taken with a high-resolution camera. Bean images obtained by computer vision system were subjected to segmentation and feature extraction stages, and a total of 16 features; 12 dimensions and 4 shape forms, were obtained from the grains.
# Project Tasks
1. Load the dataset into your preferred data analysis tool.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights about the data.
a. Visualize the distribution or value counts of all the variables.
b. Calculate the correlation between the features and between the features and target variable.
c. Summarize descriptive statistics of the variables.
3. Preprocess the data as necessary to prepare it for modeling. This should include handling missing values, dealing with outliers, and transforming the data as necessary.
4. Split the data into training and testing sets.
5. Applied the following types of models:
a. A Bagging model (e.g. Random Forest, Extra trees, etc.)
b. A boosting model (e.g. Adaboost, Gradient boosting, etc.)
6. Use stacking of multiple models to improve performance.
7. Tune hyper-parameters of the models to improve performance.
8. Analyze the feature importance from different models to gain insights about which features are most important for predicting the type of bean.
